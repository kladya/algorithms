        // sort elements into increasing /ascending/ order with advanced bubblesort:

        const sampleArray = [3.78, 0.15, 7.8259, 92.74, 45.3, 56.324];

        function bubbleSortAsc(sampleArray) {
            let swapped;
            do {
                swapped = false;
                for (let i = 0; i < sampleArray.length - 1; i += 1) {
                    if (sampleArray[i] > sampleArray[i + 1]) {
                        let temp = sampleArray[i];
                        sampleArray[i] = sampleArray[i + 1];
                        sampleArray[i + 1] = temp;
                        swapped = true;
                    }

        /* 
        Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them
        based on their values.

        If the given array has to be sorted in ascending order, then 
        bubble sort will start by comparing the first element of the 
        array with the second element, if the first element is greater 
        than the second element, it will swap both the elements, and then 
        move on to compare the second and the third element, and so on.

        If we have total n elements, then we need to repeat this process 
        for n-1 times.

        It is known as bubble sort, because with every complete iteration 
        the largest element in the given array, bubbles up towards the 
        last place or the highest index, just like a water bubble rises up 
        to the water surface.


        Following are the steps involved in bubble sort(for sorting a 
        given array in ascending order):

        1. Starting with the first element(index = 0), compare the current 
        element with the next element of the array.
        2. If the current element is greater than the next element of the 
        array, swap them.
        3. If the current element is less than the next element, move to 
        the next element. Repeat Step 1.


        Optimized Bubble Sort Algorithm:

        Another slightly more efficient way to code bubble sort that is 
        slightly more efficient is to keep track of a variable “swapped” 
        which is initially set to false. During each iteration, if values 
        are swapped, then the “swapped” variable is set to true. Then, using 
        a do-while loop, it will only run the code if the swapped variable 
        is true, thus ensuring that only 1 extra verification iteration happens.
